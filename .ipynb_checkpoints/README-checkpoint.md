# Map Plots

This repository contains tutorials dedicated to plotting maps of climate data taken from climate model simulations.

Contents are as follows:

1. Mapping Climate Data: Goes through the process of reading in a data file, selecting a range of years of interest, temporal averaging and plotting on a map using Cartopy. Global maps and maps over selected lat/lon regions are generated.

2. Mean-State and Seasonal Difference Plots: Covers the generation of difference plots in surface air temperature, over epochs defined by the user. Also includes instructions on concatenating data from multiple netCDF files, as well as filtering data based on season (DJF, MAM, etc).

3. Workbook_MapTutorials: A workbook containing comments and text explanations of analysis steps in tutorials 1 and 2, but with code left blank for the user to practice with.
